                    I have always been interested in technology and problem-solving, so I decided to learn how to code. My journey began with a few online tutorials and eventually led me to join a robotics team at my school. Working on the team allowed me to apply my coding skills to real-world projects and collaborate with like-minded individuals.

                    I became particularly interested in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) and used it to automate tasks and create custom solutions. This led me to pursue a degree path in software development, where I am currently studying computer science and learning even more about the vast field of coding.
                    
                    I am excited to continue my journey and use my skills to make a positive impact on the world through technology.
